    <h1>Projects I Have Worked On</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition</h3>
<p>Developed a program to recognize images by training our model in Residual Networks.
    Using CIFAR-10 dataset we trained our model in deep residual network which helps in handling complex deep neural networks
    for image recognition.
    Using residual networks, we could notice how effective and congenial it is to use rather traditional convolution neural networks.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Music Genre Classification using Multi-Layer Perceptron</h3>
<p>Developed a model that can accurately detect a song's genre it belongs to. The GTZAN dataset was used to train various categorization
    models that were constructed.
    Compared the performance of three classes of models namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, Random Forest (RF)
    classifier and two-layered and three-layered Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) built from scratch.
    Trained the machine learning classifiers for datasets of different durations and compared their performance.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Online Bookstore Management System</h3>
<p>Developed a database using MySQL for an online bookstore system. The system maintains information about books, subjects,
    suppliers, and shippers.
    Created a database, added tables and populated the database to the system. Additionally implemented PHP and HTML interfaces
    where the user can interact with the database by entering SQL query in the form.</p>
